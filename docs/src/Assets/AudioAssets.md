### Audio Assets

Audio Assets provide the means to generate [Audio](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/audio/Audio) objects based on their buffer information.

Audio Assets are serialized and stored in **.rogueAudio** files.

### Creating Audio Assets

To create an Audio Asset, you need to import your audio file (mp3, wav, ogg, mkv) into your project. Then, right click on that file and select **Create Audio Asset**. This will create a **.rogueAudio** file right beside the original.

### Using Audio Assets

To use an Audio Asset, drag and drop it on an [Audio](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/audio/Audio) or [PositionalAudio](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/audio/PositionalAudio) field in the inspector interface of a component.

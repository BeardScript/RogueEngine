### Runtime

The **Runtime** object is a singleton which extends [SceneController](/EngineAPI/SceneController). It handles some special cases for the generic superclass API.

In particular, this controller represents the state of the scene being played. Within the editor, this means that whenever you press play, this class will be governing the behavior of the loaded scene.

Go to [SceneController](/EngineAPI/SceneController) to see the API.

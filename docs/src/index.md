The first thing you need to do before installing Rogue Engine is to make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed in your computer.

If you're not sure, you should open a terminal and write the following command:

```bash

This should show you the Node.js version, if you get an error, it means you need to [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

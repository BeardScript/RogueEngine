## Intro

The purpose of this repository is to hold the source of the Rogue Engine docs and to provide issue tracking.

Here you'll be able to:

- Report bugs
- Request features
- Ask for help
- Contribute with the documentation.
- See the roadmap (soon)

## Three.js as an open core

Three.js is a first class citizen in Rogue Engine. You'll be using it constantly within your components. Rogue Engine provides a set of tools around three.js to help you build your web apps and games with it. Even migrating your current three.js code into Rogue Engine, should be relatively straightforward. You'll find that your new architecture will be more robust, reusable and easier to collaborate.

This means, naturally, that you'll be using the [three.js docs](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/introduction/Creating-a-scene) a lot.
